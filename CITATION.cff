  MuSpinSim is a Python software meant to simulate
  muon spectroscopy experiments. In particular, it
  simulates the spin dynamics of a system of a muon
  plus other spins, namely electrons and atomic
  nuclei. It can simulate various common experimental
  setups and account for hyperfine, dipolar and
  quadrupolar couplings. It is also able to fit its
  simulations to experimental data, to find the
  optimal parameters that describe it.
