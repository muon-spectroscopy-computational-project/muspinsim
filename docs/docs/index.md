# Welcome to MuSpinSim's documentation

MuSpinSim is a program designed to carry out spin dynamics calculations for 
muon science experiments. MuSpinSim can:

* simulate zero, transverse and longitudinal field experiments
* simulate experiments resolved in time, field, or temperature
* include the effects of hyperfine, dipolar, quadrupolar and Zeeman couplings
* simulate quantum systems exchanging energy with the environment with the Lindblad master equation
* fit experimental data with simulations using all of the above
* run in parallel on multiple cores for the most expensive tasks

## Topics
* Learn about the [theory of spin dynamics behind MuSpinSim](./theory_1.md);
* go into more detail into the [Hamiltonian](./hamiltonian.md) used in simulations;
* follow the [tutorial](./tutorial.md);
* check out the list of [input keywords](./input.md);
* or learn by doing through our many [examples](./examples.md)!
